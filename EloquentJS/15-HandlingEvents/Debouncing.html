<!--
    SOme type of events have the potential to fire rapidly, many times in a row.
    When handling such events, you must be careful not to do anything too time- consuming or your handler will take up so much time that interaction with the document starts to feel slow.

    If you do need to do something nontrivial in such a handler, you can use *setTimeout* to make sure you are not doing it too often. This is usually called debouncing the event
