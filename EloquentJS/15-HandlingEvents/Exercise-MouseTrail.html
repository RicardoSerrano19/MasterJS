<!--
    In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home
    pages with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly
    inspiring ways to use the language.
    One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would
    follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.
    In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use abso-
    lutely positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color
    (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create
    a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in
    the wake of the mouse pointer.
    There are various possible approaches here. You can make your so-
    lution as simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start
    with is to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through
    them, moving the next one to the mouse’s current position every time
    a "mousemove" event occurs.
