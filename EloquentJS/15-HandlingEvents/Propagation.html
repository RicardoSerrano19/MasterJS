<!--
    Handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive events that happen in the children.
    If a button inside a paragraph is clicked, event handlers on the paragraph will also see the click event.
    This is called *propagation*.
    Event handler can call the event.stopPropagation() method on the vent object to prevend handlers further up from receiving the event

    Most event objects have a *target* property that refers to the node where they originated.
    **** IMPORTANT *** 
    If you have a node containing a long list of buttons, it may be more convenient to register a single click handler on the outer node and have it use the target property to figure out whether a button was clicked, rather than register indicidual handlers on all the buttons
