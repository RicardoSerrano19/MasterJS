  An asynchronous model allows multiple thing to happen at the same time. WHen you start an action, your program continues to run.

  # Working with abstract concepts is often easier when those concepts can be represented by values. In the case of asynchronous actions, you could, instead of arranging for a function to be callet at some point in the future, return an object that represents this future event.
  
  A *promise* is an asynchronous action that may complete at some point and produce a value. It is able to notify anyone who is interested when its value is available.
