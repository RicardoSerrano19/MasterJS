/* ðŸ“ƒ Asynchronicity
  # In a synchronous programming model, thins happen one at a time, it returns only when the action has finished and it can return the result. THis stops you program for the time the action takes
  
  Synchronous single thread of control.

  An asynchronous model allows multiple thing to happen at the same time. WHen you start an action, your program continues to run.
  
  Asynchronous.

/* ðŸ“ƒ Callbacks
  # One approach to asynchronous programming is to make functions that perform a slow action take an extra argument, a *callback function*. THe action is started, and when it finished, the callback function is called with the result.

/* ðŸ“ƒ Promises
  # Working with abstract concepts is often easier when those concepts can be represented by values. In the case of asynchronous actions, you could, instead of arranging for a function to be callet at some point in the future, return an object that represents this future event.
  
  A *promise* is an asynchronous action that may complete at some point and produce a value. It is able to notify anyone who is interested when its value is available.

// To get the result of a promise, you can use its *then method*. This registers a callback function to be called when the promise resolves and produces a value.
// Its posible add multiple callbacks to a single promise, and they will be called, even if you add them after the promise has already resolved (finished)
