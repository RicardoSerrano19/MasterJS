<!-- You can imagine an HTML document as a nested set of boxes. Tags
such as <body> and </body> enclose other tags, which in turn contain
other tags or text.

For each box, there is an object, which we can interact
with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which
boxes and text it contains. This representation is called the Document
Object Model, or DOM for short.
