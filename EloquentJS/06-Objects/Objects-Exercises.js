/* A vector typeüèÜ 
#  Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It
takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties
of the same name.
Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus , that take an-
other vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or
difference of the two vectors‚Äô ( this and the parameter) x and y values.
Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the
length of the vector‚Äîthat is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the
origin (0, 0).
*/

class Vec {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
  plus(vector) {
    return new Vec(this.x + vector.x, this.y + vector.y);
  }
  minus(vector) {
    return new Vec(this.x - vector.x, this.y - vector.y);
  }

  get length() {
    return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.x, 2) + Math.pow(this.y, 2));
  }
}

console.log(new Vec(1, 2).plus(new Vec(2, 3)));
console.log(new Vec(1, 2).minus(new Vec(2, 3)));
console.log(new Vec(3, 4).length);

/* GroupsüèÜ 
#  The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure
called Set . Like an instance of Map , a set holds a collection of values.
Unlike Map , it does not associate other values with those‚Äîit just tracks
which values are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only
once‚Äîadding it again doesn‚Äôt have any effect.
Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set , it has
add , delete , and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group,
add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn‚Äôt already a member),
delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and
has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a mem-
ber of the group.
Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf , to
determine whether two values are the same.
Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as
argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by
iterating over it.
*/
class Group {
  constructor() {
    this.group = [];
  }
  add(value) {
    if (!this.has(value)) this.group.push(value);
  }
  delete(value) {
    this.group = this.group.filter((el) => el !== value);
  }
  has(value) {
    return this.group.includes(value);
  }
  static from(colection) {
    let newGroup = new Group();
    for (let value of colection) {
      newGroup.add(value);
    }
    return newGroup;
  }
}

let grupo = new Group();
console.log(grupo);
grupo.add(1);
grupo.add(2);
grupo.add(3);
console.log(grupo);
console.log(grupo.has(91));
let newGrupo = Group.from([4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 22]);
console.log(newGrupo);
newGrupo.delete(22);
console.log(newGrupo);

/* Iterable groupsüèÜ 
#  Make the Group class from the previous exercise iterable. Refer to the
section about the iterator interface earlier in the chapter if you aren‚Äôt
clear on the exact form of the interface anymore.
If you used an array to represent the group‚Äôs members, don‚Äôt just
return the iterator created by calling the Symbol.iterator method on
the array. That would work, but it defeats the purpose of this exercise.
It is okay if your iterator behaves strangely when the group is modi-
fied during iteration.
*/

class GroupIterator {
  constructor(group) {
    this.current = 0;
    this.group = group;
  }

  next() {
    if (this.current === this.group.group.length) return { done: true };
    let result = { value: this.group.group[this.current], donde: false };
    this.current++;
    return result;
  }
}

Group.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function () {
  return new GroupIterator(this);

let grupo1 = Group.from([4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 22]);
for (let element of grupo1) {
  console.log(element);
}

/* Borrowing a methodüèÜ 
#  Earlier in the chapter I mentioned that an object‚Äôs hasOwnProperty can
be used as a more robust alternative to the in operator when you want
to ignore the prototype‚Äôs properties. But what if your map needs to
include the word "hasOwnProperty" ? You won‚Äôt be able to call that
method anymore because the object‚Äôs own property hides the method
value.
Can you think of a way to call hasWOwnProperty on an object that has
its own property by that name?.
*/
let map = { one: true, two: true, hasOwnProperty: true };
console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call('one'));
